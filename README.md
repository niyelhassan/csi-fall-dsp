# An Ensemble Framework for Fall Detection Using Multivariate Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)

## Abstract
Falls are a significant health concern globally, especially among the elderly. Traditional fall detection systems, while useful, often suffer from being costly, intrusive, and inaccurate. Our project introduces a novel approach to fall detection using Wi-Fi sensing, a non-invasive method leveraging existing wireless network infrastructure. The core of our project is a signal processing framework designed specifically for Wi-Fi based fall detection. This framework, developed through extensive research and testing, utilizes advanced filtering, feature extraction, and predictive algorithms to enhance detection accuracy and efficiency. A key achievement of our framework is its superior performance over previous systems, as validated by a Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), which showed a statistically significant improvement with a p-value of 0.026 (alpha = 0.05). This framework not only marks a significant advancement in fall detection technology but also lays the groundwork for future innovations in Wi-Fi sensing applications.

## Installation
To install the fall detection framework, follow these steps:

1. **System Requirements**: Ensure your system meets the following requirements:
   - Operating System: Windows 10 or later, MacOS 10.14 or later, Linux distribution supporting Python 3.6+


2. **Installing Dependencies**: 
   - Install Python 3.6 or later from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org).
   - Install necessary Python libraries using pip: 
     ```bash
     pip install numpy scipy sklearn pandas
     ```

3. **Downloading the Software**:
   - Clone the repository from GitHub: 
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-github-repo/fall-detection-wifi.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the cloned directory:
     ```bash
     cd fall-detection-wifi
     ```


## Usage
To use the fall detection system, run each file with the UT-HAR dataset. Extract each set of data features, for each data filter, and pass the data to each machine learning algorithm for evaluvation.
